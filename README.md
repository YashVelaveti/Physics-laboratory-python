# Computational Physics Projects

A collection of numerical simulations and data analysis tools exploring fundamental physics phenomena across thermal dynamics, quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and spectroscopy.

## Projects Overview

### Heat Conduction
Numerical solutions to heat diffusion problems using finite difference methods. Explores temperature evolution in few dimensions.

### Quantum Transport
Simulations of quantum mechanical transport phenomena, including tunneling effects and conductance calculations in nanoscale systems.

### Atomic Wavefunctions and Orbitals
Visualization and computation of hydrogen-like atomic orbitals, exploring the spatial probability distributions of electron wavefunctions in various quantum states.

### Spectroscopy Analysis
Data processing pipelines for spectroscopic measurements, including wavelength calibration, line identification, and spectral feature extraction.

## Technical Approach

These projects combine theoretical physics with computational methods, primarily using Python with NumPy for numerical calculations and Matplotlib for visualization. The implementations focus on translating mathematical physics into practical numerical algorithms.

**Note:** Some projects include utility functions and helper modules provided as part of structured physics problems. The core physics implementations and analysis are original work.
